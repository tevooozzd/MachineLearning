What is a MATRIX?
 ->Basically MATRIXS are BIDIMENSIONAL ARRAYS
    ->What is a ARRAY? -> Array it's a struct o data that store a collection of elements in order, and we can acess all these elements by indexs

Examples:

        MATRIZ1 = [ 1 2 
                    3 4 ]

                    This is a BIDIMENSIONAL ARRAY, have at least 2 row and 2 columns, in this example we call this 2x2 (2 rows, 2 columns)

        MATRIZ2  = [ 1 2 3
                     4 5 6
                     7 8 9 ]
                     This is a BIDIMENSIONAL ARRAY (3x3 -> 3 rows, 3 columns)

- In Python don't have a native form to arrays, so if we need to use arrays, it's necessary use the numpy library (np) and use a function
- Otherwise in languages like C, C++ and more, have arrays in the native form.
