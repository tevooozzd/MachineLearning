What is a vector?
 -> Basically VECTORS ARE UNIDIMENSIONAL ARRAYS
    ->What is a ARRAY? -> Array it's a struct o data that store a collection of elements in order, and we can acess all these elements by indexs

Examples:

        MATRIZ1 = [ 1 2 ]

                    This is a DIMENSIONAL ARRAY, have 1 row OR 1 column, in this example we call this 1x2 (1 row, 2 column)

        MATRIZ2  = [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ]
                     This is a DIMENSIONAL ARRAY (1x6 -> 1 rows, 6 columns)

        MATRIX3 - [ 0
                    1
                    2
                    3
                    4
                    5
                     ]
                    This is a DIMENSIONAL ARRAY (6x1 -> 6 rows, 1 column)

- In Python don't have a native form to arrays, so if we need to use arrays, it's necessary use the numpy library (np) and use a function
- Otherwise in languages like C, C++ and more, have arrays in the native form.
