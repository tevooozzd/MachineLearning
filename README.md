# Machine Learning - February 2025 Learning Journey

This repository contains the hands-on **Machine Learning** learning material that I am developing during the year 2025. My goal is to learn the main ML concepts and algorithms, use Jupiter Notebook to do so, and record all my progress here on GitHub.

##Structure

- **/notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with explanation and experiments.
- **/scripts**: Python scripts with implementation examples.
- **/data**: Data used in notebooks and scripts (whenever possible).
- **requirements.txt**: List of packages needed to run the code.

## Objectives

- Study **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning.
- Implement classic algorithms, such as **linear regression**, **Decision Trees**, **K-Means**, and more.
- Document and share my journey with the community.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/seu_usuario/ML-Learning-Repo.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run notebooks to keep track of learning.
